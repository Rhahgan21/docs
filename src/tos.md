# Terms of Service

These Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) explain the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Products provided by Canxium (referred to herein as “Canxium”, “we”, “our”, or “us”).

The Products shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, [https://app.canxium.org/](https://app.canxium.org/), a website-hosted user interface (the “Interface” or “App”) and Canxium Wallet. You must read this Agreement carefully as it governs your use of the Products. By accessing or using any of the Products, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to access or use any of our Products and should not use our Products.

To access or use any of our Products, you must be able to form a legally binding contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g., 18 years old in the United States) and have the full right, power, and authority to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity for which you may access or use the Interface. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent to us that you have the legal authority to bind such entity.

> **NOTICE:** This Agreement contains important information, including a binding arbitration provision and a class action waiver, both of which impact your rights as to how disputes are resolved. Our Products are only available to you — and you should only access any of our Products — if you agree completely with these terms.

## 1. Our Products

### 1.1 The Interface

The Interface provides a web or mobile-based means of access to a decentralized protocol on various public blockchains, including but not limited to Canxium and Ethereum that allows users to trade certain compatible digital assets (the “Canxium protocol” or the “Protocol”). The Interface is distinct from the Protocol and is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. The Protocol itself comprises open-source or source-available self-executing smart contracts that are deployed on various public blockchains, such as Canxium or Ethereum. By using the Interface, you understand that you are not buying or selling digital assets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. When traders pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to liquidity providers for the Protocol.

### 1.2 Other Products

We may from time to time in the future offer additional products, and such additional products shall be considered a Product as used herein, regardless of whether such product is specifically defined in this Agreement.

### 1.3 Third Party Services and Content

When you use any of our Products, you may also be using the products, services, or content of one or more third parties. Your use of such third-party products, services, or content may be subject to separate policies, terms of use, and fees of these third parties, and you agree to abide by and be responsible for such policies, terms of use, and fees, as applicable.
