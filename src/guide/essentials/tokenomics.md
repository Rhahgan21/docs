Before the **Hydro Fork** at block 4,354,526, the block reward 0.25 CAU on the Canxium blockchain follows a clear structure:

- **75% to Miners**:  
  The majority of the block reward, 75%, is credited to the miners. This incentivizes miners for their contribution to securing the network and validating transactions. It ensures that the mining participants receive a significant portion of the reward for their computational work in the Proof of Work (PoW) system.

- **25% to Foundation Fund**:  
  The remaining 25% of the block reward is allocated to the foundation fund. This portion is dedicated to supporting the development, marketing, and overall growth of Canxium during the early stages of its operation. This fund helps ensure the sustainability of the project by financing key activities such as research, marketing campaigns, community engagement, and infrastructure development.

This reward model helps Canxium balance between incentivizing miners and ensuring the long-term viability and expansion of the ecosystem through continued development efforts.

With the **Hydro Fork**, these dynamics might change as Canxium transitions towards Proof of Stake (PoS) and updates the reward distribution mechanism to align with the evolving network model.

After the **Hydro Fork**, Canxium transitioned to **offline mining**, with the reward distribution for transaction mining adjusted as follows:

- **70% to 75% to Offline Miners**:  
  A significant portion of the transaction mining rewards, ranging from 70% to 75%, is allocated to offline miners. These miners are responsible for generating valid mining transactions and submitting them to the network. The reward is proportional to the difficulty level chosen by the miner, encouraging active participation while promoting energy-efficient mining practices.

- **15% to Canxium's Validators**:  
  Validators receive 15% of the transaction mining rewards. Their role involves verifying and finalizing the mined transactions, ensuring the integrity and security of the blockchain. Validators continue to play a crucial role in the Canxium ecosystem by validating the blocks and transactions generated by offline miners.

- **10% to 15% to Foundation Funds**:  
  The remaining 10% to 15% of the rewards are directed to the foundation fund. This portion supports the development, marketing, and operational costs of Canxium, helping to fund ecosystem growth, research, community initiatives, and infrastructure improvements.
