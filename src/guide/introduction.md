## What is Canxium?

Canxium is a groundbreaking blockchain platform that introduces a unique economic model driven by supply and demand dynamics. Unlike traditional blockchains with fixed supplies or inflationary/deflationary mechanisms, Canxium utilizes a demand-driven approach, where the total coin supply is determined by market demand. This dynamic system allows the blockchain to adapt and respond to real-time market conditions, making it more flexible and sustainable.

Unlike traditional models that rely on predetermined supply plans, Canxium empowers market forces to dictate the availability and value of its coins. This approach creates a more adaptable ecosystem, aligning the blockchain’s performance with the fluctuations of the market.

In addition to its economic innovation, Canxium has revolutionized blockchain technology with its unique approach to mining. The platform is committed to building a more sustainable and decentralized future. One of its most distinguishing features is the innovative concept of offline mining — an entirely new idea within the cryptocurrency space.

## Why Canxium?

Choosing Canxium blockchain offers several unique advantages that set it apart from traditional blockchain networks:

Demand-Driven Supply Mechanism: Unlike blockchains with fixed or inflationary supplies, Canxium’s supply is responsive to market demand, which helps stabilize its value and reduces extreme price volatility. This approach adjusts supply based on mining difficulty and market needs, promoting a sustainable and balanced ecosystem​.

Offline Mining: Canxium introduces an innovative "offline mining" capability, which allows miners to participate without requiring continuous internet connectivity. This feature not only decentralizes mining but also lowers entry barriers for miners globally, making the network more inclusive and energy-efficient​.

Smart Contract Quality Control: To enhance the ecosystem’s quality and security, Canxium imposes a minimum fee of 100 CAU for creating smart contracts. This discourages low-quality or spam contracts, helping ensure that projects on Canxium are credible and reducing risks for users​.

Broad Applicability: With features supporting DeFi, cross-border payments, and everyday transactions, Canxium is designed for versatile use cases. The blockchain supports high-quality smart contracts compatible with Ethereum’s virtual machine (EVM), fostering an environment for secure and scalable decentralized applications​.

Hybrid Consensus Model and Transition to PoS: Canxium operates with a hybrid model, initially using Proof of Work (PoW) but transitioning to a Proof of Stake (PoS) sidechain model with Offline Mining (PoW). This shift will enhance scalability and lower environmental impact by significantly reducing energy demands​.

Overall, Canxium blockchain’s combination of demand-driven supply, offline mining, quality-controlled smart contracts, and a transition to PoS offers a stable, accessible, and innovative option for users and developers alike.

| Feature                       | **Canxium PoW Coin**                                         | **Other PoW Coins (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin)**              |

| **Reward Adjustment**         | Dynamic adjustment based on network demand, offering flexibility | Fixed or scheduled reward halving, reducing rewards over time |
| **Hardware Compatibility**    | Supports multiple PoW algorithms, works with diverse devices | Limited to specific hardware (e.g., Bitcoin uses ASICs)      |
| **Mining Flexibility**        | Allows diverse mining setups, no reliance on mining pools   | Often dependent on mining pools, leading to centralization  |
| **Network Resilience**        | Adaptable to a range of mining strategies, potentially more resilient to attacks | High hash power makes Bitcoin very secure but less flexible |
| **Transaction Speed**         | Optimized for faster transactions with lower fees            | Generally slower (Bitcoin), with transaction fees based on congestion |
| **Scalability**               | Designed to scale with network demand and diverse mining practices | Scalability often depends on protocol upgrades and Bitcoin's block size limit |
| **Decentralization**          | More decentralized by removing the need for mining pools     | PoW coins often become centralized in mining pools          |
| **Stability**                 | Anti-price volatility through stable mining costs            | High volatility due to fluctuating mining difficulty and rewards |

| **Market Volatility**         | Higher volatility can lead to greater profit potential        | Stability limits profit-making opportunities due to pegged value |
| **Security**                  | High security through mining and decentralized consensus    | Security tied to the issuer and collateral reserves         |
| **Adoption**                  | Gaining adoption in crypto communities, for those looking for a reliable PoW coin | Already widely adopted, but limited to users seeking stability |
| **Expansion Potential**       | Can expand with market demand due to stable mining costs and high rewards | Faces high risk with expansion, as they are pegged to fiat and may face issues with liquidity and collateral reserves |

## What is Canxium's consensus?

Canxium is currently the only blockchain that simultaneously utilizes three distinct consensus algorithms, working in tandem to complement each other and minimize the shortcomings of each individual algorithm.

The three consensus algorithms in Canxium include:

Proof of Stake: Anyone can become a validator on Canxium with just 320 CAU, allowing them to validate and operate the Canxium blockchain while earning rewards.

Proof of Demand: A decentralized supply control mechanism that adjusts based on real market demand.

Proof of Work: Miners play a key role in generating new CAU tokens and can even mine offline if they wish.
